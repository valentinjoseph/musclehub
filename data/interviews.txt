I always wanted to work out like all of the shredded people on the fitness accounts I see on Instagram, but I never really knew how to start. MuscleHub’s introductory fitness test was super helpful for me! After taking the fitness test, I had to sign up and keep coming back so that I could impress my trainer Rachel with how much I was improving!

When I walked into MuscleHub I wasn’t accosted by any personal trainers trying to sell me some mumbo jumbo, which I really appreciated. Down at LiftCity they had me doing burpees 30 seconds after I walked in the door and I was like “woah guys slow your roll, this is TOOOO much for Jesse!” I still ended up not signing up for a membership because the weight machines had all those sweat stains on them and you know, no thanks.

I took the MuscleHub fitness test because my coworker Laura recommended it. Regretted it.

I saw an ad for MuscleHub on BookFace and thought I'd check it out! The people there were suuuuuper friendly and the whole sign-up process took a matter of minutes. I tried to sign up for LiftCity last year, but the fitness test was way too intense. This is my first gym membership EVER, and MuscleHub made me feel welcome.
